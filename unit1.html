        <p style="padding: 5px 50px 10px 50px; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 18px; color: #0abdc6"> I find it has many parallels to the way corporate structure and the first world is going now. 
            Cyberpunk is a warning to what may happen if the government allows unchecked corporations to get out of hand. Unfortunately, this is evident during congress hearings on new technologies. 
            In which they clearly lack the understanding of these new technologies. As well as the lack of any actual antitrust breakups in recent decades. </p>
        <h3 style="font-family: Garamond, serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; color: #fcee0c"><big><b><center>The pros of Cyberpunk. </big></b></center></h3>
        <p style="padding: 5px 50px 10px 50px; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 18px; color: #0abdc6"> Many advancements in recent human history have been mostly digital. 
            Although, with the exponential advancement of Artificial Intelligence that will soon change. 
            In that, the physical world will start to begin to change. New methods and procedures in material science are brought about because of the new age of accelerated tech.
            Redefining the capabilities of our societies. </p>
        <h3 style="font-family: Garamond, serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; color: #fcee0c"><big><b><center>Where do I see the future going?</big></b></center></h3>
        <p style="padding: 5px 50px 10px 50px; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 18px; color: #0abdc6"> 
            I see the invention and usage of photonic chips as the new way forward. The limitations of electrons are beginning to exceed Mooreâ€™s Law.
            Therefore, the photon will be able to enhance our current technology. With a significant decrease in thermal heat, and fast as light calculations. 
            This technology can be used on 3-Dimensional Topological Dirac Semimetals, such as Graphene or Bismuth. Thus, taking full advantage of the wave and particle functionality of quasiparticles.
