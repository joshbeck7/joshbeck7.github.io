        <h3> Mindset</h3>
        <h4> Goals</h4>
        <p> One needs to ensure they are in the right mindset. No stressors affecting them at the current moment. As all the little subconscious things can effect one's trading experience. <br />

            Additionally one should have backtested strategies throughout to ensure they have a positive expected value in the market. <br />
            
            Most importantly what are the goals of the stock trader. Is it for retirement money, quick cash, or a living? These are fundamentally different mindsets. I trade all 3 ways simultaneously.

        <h3> Research</h3>
        <p> One must do proper research to position themselves positively. </p>
        <h4> News</h4>
        <p> What is the current news in the markets? As this is how even the most novice of traders will look at the market. Once one figures that out they can choose to go for fundamental analysis.</p>
        <h4> Fundamental Analysis</h4>
        <p> Is the stock they are about to invest in overvalued, undervalued, or at fair value? Is it a value stock or a growth stock?</p>
        <h4> Technical Analysis</h4>
        <p> Technical Analysis is for one to stare at the charts and to see which way the direct market is influencing the stock. Is the stock deviating from the mean or trending towards it? </p>

        <h3> Risk Management</h3>
        <h4> Kelly Criterion</h4>
        <p> Most traders use the 2% of their portfolio rule. While others use Kelly Criterion calculations. Do not use Kelly Criterion unless one has tested they're specific strategy a 1000 times to see an assessment. Another thing to watch out for is ranging markets which occur 85% of the time.</p>

        <h3> Simple Trade Scenario</h3>
        <p> Say I want to trade a stock. I will wake up early before the market opens. 
            Then I will check for volume of stocks to see if they are larger than normal.
            Then I will visit sites to check out the news for that stock and see the social media sentiment.
            If everything is positive then I will check the charts to see if those are positive as well. 
            Then by checking the fundamentals quickly I can see if a trade is worth my time or not. If it is then
            I lock in for an appropriate amount of Kelly Criterion portfolio sizing and wait until my stock hits one of two levels.
